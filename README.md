# myMagicMirror
based on the open source project: https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror I wanted to use a tv I had lying around for pretty pictures, weather, and my calendar.

I don't have a mirror, just the tv. I'm using an older raspberry pi. 

The weather requires a private key, which I'm hoping I remember to remove before uploading. The picture froze on the first day. My calendar did not display, so I used the default. I also want to be sure to keep the private ical link private. I found a stock ticker and that was cool, but way too distracting for me at my desk.

Later, I'd like to use pm2 to auto load the MagicMirror.
